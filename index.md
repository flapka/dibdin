<h2 id="5c5">5C5. Publications consisting entirely or chiefly of illustrations</h2>

If a publication consists entirely or chiefly of illustrations, account for this fact by specifying `all ill.` or `chiefly ill.` Optionally, when the illustrations are all or chiefly of a particular type (see [5C2.2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0)), replace `ill.` with the term specifying the particular type.
